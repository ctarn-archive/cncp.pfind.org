shenjiechen,申洁晨,西北大学,/doc/bio/shenjiechen.pdf,StrucGP: De Novo Structural Sequencing of Site-specific N-Glycans on Glycoproteins Using a Modularization Strategy,"Precision mapping of glycans at structural and site-specific level is still one of the most challenging tasks in the glycobiology field. Here, we describe a novel modularization strategy for de novo interpretation of N-glycan structures on intact glycopeptides using tandem mass spectrometry. A new algorithm named StrucGP is also developed to automate the interpretation process for large-scale analysis. By dividing an N-glycan into three modules and identifying each module using distinct patterns of Y ions or a combination of distinguishable B/Y ions, the method enables determination of detailed glycan structures on thousands of glycosites in mouse brain, which are comprised of four types of core structures and seventeen branch structures with three glycan subtypes. Owing to the database-independent glycan mapping strategy, StrucGP also facilitates the identification of rare/new glycan structures. The approach will be greatly beneficial for in-depth structural and functional study of glycoproteins in the biomedical research.","Glycoproteomics, Glycan structure, Mass spectrometry, Glycosylation",,
yangyi,杨奕,复旦大学,/doc/bio/yangyi.pdf,GproDIA enables data-independent acquisition glycoproteomics with comprehensive statistical control,"Large-scale profiling of intact glycopeptides is critical but challenging in glycoproteomics. Data independent acquisition (DIA) is an emerging technology with deep proteome coverage and accurate quantitative capability in proteomics studies, but is still in the early stage of development in the field of glycoproteomics. We propose GproDIA, a framework that applies the concept of peptide-centric DIA analysis to proteome-wide characterization of intact glycopeptides with comprehensive statistical control by a two-dimentional false discovery rate approach and a glycoform inference algorithm, enabling accurate identification of intact glycopeptides using wide isolation windows. We further utilize a semi-empirical spectrum prediction strategy to expand the coverage of spectral libraries of glycopeptides. We hbenchmark our method for N-glycopeptide profiling on DIA data of yeast and human serum samples, demonstrating that DIA with GproDIA outperforms the data-dependent acquisition-based methods for glycoproteomics in terms of capacity and data completeness of identification, as well as accuracy and precision of quantification. We expect that this work can provide a powerful tool for glycoproteomic studies.",,,
