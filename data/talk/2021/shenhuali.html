<h3>Cancer Serum Atlas combining pan-targeted mass spectrometry supports proteomics-based multi-cancer diagnosis</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Early cancer detection could give better chance of long-term survival to cancer patients. The emerging multi-cancer diagnosis approach owns potential to address the large unmet need in more inclusive and cost-effective way. Yet, such approach would require high specificity, sensitivity, and highly accurate tissue of origin (TOO) identification. In this study, we developed a proteomics-based approach for multi-cancer diagnosis. Firstly, we conducted a systematic data-mining of the potentially secreted, cancer-associated proteins from the published clinical-proteomics datasets of seven common cancer types with high morbidity and mortality. Over two thousand proteins were screened as candidate cancer biomarkers that could be detectable in the blood of individuals. Unique peptides of each protein were synthesized and high-quality MS/MS and PRM spectra were acquired. All the result data were presented in the database named “Cancer Serum Atlas”(www.cancerserumatlas.com). Then we developed a pan-targeted MS strategy that can precisely quantify up to 800 proteins in one run and applied this strategy to quantify 485 detectable cancer biomarkers in sera of 293 individuals who are healthy or with 4 different types of cancer. To further improve the specificity of the multi-cancer diagnosis, a previously developed PPC-VDE algorithm was introduced which generated large number of cancer-specific features through quantify the protein-protein co-regulations. Taken together, the Cancer Serum Atlas combining pan-targeted MS approach presented great effectiveness in multi-cancer diagnosis and can be widely used to other blood-based cancer studies.
