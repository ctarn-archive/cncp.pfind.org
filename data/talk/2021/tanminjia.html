<h3>Proteomic characterization of protein post-translational modifications identifies new therapeutic opportunities</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) play fundamental roles in cellular physiology and disease development. Yet current understanding of the inventory and function of PTMs is by far limited. In this talk, I will present our recent study on the systematic characterization of PTMs in several types of disease models and clinical samples using mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies. Our pervious study demonstrated that targeting epigenetic crosstalk as a therapeutic strategy for ezh2-aberrant solid tumors. Integrative proteomics analysis of 103 cases of human lung adenocarcinoma enables a more comprehensive understanding of its molecular landscape. Global identification of phospho-dependent SCF substrates reveals a FBXO22 phosphodegron and an ERK-FBXO22-BAG3 axis in tumorigenesis. Our integrative proteomics identifies the combination of DOT1L and SHP2 inhibitors as an effective treatment for a subset of KRAS mutant cancer. These studies led to the identification of new mechanisms, biomarkers, and therapeutic approaches in diseases.
