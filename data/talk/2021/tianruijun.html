<h3>MS-based protein complex profiling in time and space</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Proteins are major building blocks of the cell, which play structural, catalytic, and regulatory roles through more than 100,000 dynamic proteinâˆ’protein interactions in the cell at any given time. In order to precisely coordinate these protein machines, it is critical that these protein complexes form at the right time and in the right place. To systematically characterize these dynamic protein complexes, we have developed a series of integrated sample preparation methods for specifically capturing and enriching them directly from clinical samples and living cells. By combining with advanced mass spectrometry, we could systematically identify these functional protein complexes and accurately quantify their dynamic modulation in a spatiotemporal manner. In this talk, I will mainly present our recent progress for applying these new proteomic methods to characterize tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated membrane receptor complexes and specifically discussing related bioinformatic efforts for improving analysis selectivity and sensitivity.
