<h3>Continual learning in cryoEM particle picking</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Before we can process the biological images of cryo-electron microscopy(cryoEM), the prerequisite is to be able to see the sample of interest, so we need methods such as particle picking to find the protein or other objects of interest. However, limited by the radiation damage, the signal-to-noise ratio of cryoEM micrographs is very low, and hence the particle picking is often challenges and labor consuming. While Template matching has been widely to accelerate particle picking. it requires manual intervention and the provision of templates, consequently, relies heavily on the user's experience and is not friendly to the automated processing.</p>
<p>Deep learning methods are showing great potential due to their ability in object identification. Although deep learning methods no longer require users to directly provide templates, they still need enough training data to ensure the correctness and accuracy of recognition. In order to achieve fully automated, even intelligent, we have introduced a continual learning method based on the deep learning framework for the particle picking task. The significance of continual learning is that deep neural networks can be continuously trained and enhanced. In continual applications, the computer can continuously learn new feature knowledge, accumulate, and become more and more powerful.</p>
