<h3>Bridging Mass Spectrometry with GPCR Biology: Discovery of Potential Therapeutic Targets</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Transmembrane proteins play vital roles in mediating synaptic transmission, plasticity and homeostasis in the brain. However, these proteins, especially the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are under-represented in most large-scale proteomic surveys. Here, we present a new proteomic approach aided by deep learning-based spectral library prediction for comprehensive profiling of transmembrane protein families in multiple mouse brain regions. Our multiregional proteome profiling highlights the considerable discrepancy between mRNA and protein distribution, especially for region-enriched GPCRs, and predicts an endogenous GPCR interaction network in the brain. Furthermore, our new approach reveals the transmembrane proteome remodeling landscape in the brain of a mouse depression model, which led to the identification of two novel GPCR regulators of depressive-like behaviors. Our study provides an enabling technology and rich data resource to expand the understanding of transmembrane proteome organization and dynamics in the brain as well as accelerate the discovery of potential therapeutic targets for depression treatment.
