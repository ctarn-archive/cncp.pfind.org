<h3>DIA proteomics with in silico spectral libraries by deep learning and DIA glycoproteomics</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Data-independent acquisition (DIA) is an emerging technology for quantitative proteomic analysis of large cohorts of samples. However, sample-specific spectral libraries built by data-dependent acquisition (DDA) experiments are required prior to DIA analysis, which is time-consuming and limits the identification/quantification by DIA to the peptides identified by DDA. Recently, we developed DeepDIA, a deep learning-based approach to generate in silico spectral libraries for DIA analysis [1]. We demonstrate that the quality of in silico libraries predicted by instrument-specific models using DeepDIA is comparable to that of experimental libraries, and outperforms libraries generated by global models. With peptide detectability prediction, in silico libraries can be built directly from protein sequence databases. We further illustrate that DeepDIA can break through the limitation of DDA on peptide/protein detection, and enhance DIA analysis on human serum samples compared to the state-of-the-art protocol using a DDA library. Due to the emergence of timsTOF pro and FAIMS, we further extended the tool box of DeepDIA for ion mobility prediction. Now, the DeepDIA also supports data from timsTOF pro and FAIMS orbitrap.</p>

<p>On the other topic, we recently developed GproDIA, a framework for DIA glycoproteomics with comprehensive statistical control by a 2-dimentional false discovery rate approach and a glycoform inference algorithm, enabling accurate identification of intact glycopeptides using wide isolation windows [2]. We benchmark our method for N-glycopeptide profiling on DIA data of yeast and human serum samples, demonstrating that DIA with GlycoSWATH outperforms the data dependent acquisition (DDA) based methods for glycoproteomics in terms of capacity and data completeness of identification, as well as accuracy and precision of quantification. We expect that this work can provide a powerful tool for glycoproteomic studies.</p>
