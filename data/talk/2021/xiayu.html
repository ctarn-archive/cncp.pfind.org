<h3>Large-Scale Lipid Profiling with Isomer Resolving Capabilities</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a primary tool in lipidomics for global lipid identification and quantitation. Despite the fact that multi-level structural information is available from MS and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), localization of carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is difficult from current analysis workflows. Our group is interested in harnessing radical chemistry for enhanced lipid analysis. We have paired the Paternò–Büchi (PB) reaction with tandem mass spectrometry (PB-MS/MS) for pinpointing C=Cs in unsaturated lipids. Acetone and aryl ketones are used as the PB reagents. Upon 254 nm ultra-violet irradiation, the PB reagent adds onto a C=C via [2+2] cycloaddition, forming the PB products. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the PB products produces C=C diagnostic fragment ions, allowing localization of C=C as well as isomer quantitation. The PB-MS/MS approach has been applied for shotgun lipid analysis and more recently hyphenated with liquid chromatography (LC)-MS. The LC-PB-MS platform enabled large-scale identification of unsaturated glycerophospholipids. It was found that the ratios of C=C isomers were much less affected by interpersonal variations than their individual abundances, allowing more sensitive discovery of lipid markers.
