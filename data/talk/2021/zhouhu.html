<h3>In-depth proteogenomic analysis characterizes the molecular features of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
To obtain a comprehensive molecular understanding of Chinese HCC patients with HBV infection (CHCC-HBV), paired tumor and non-tumor liver tissues from 159 HCC patients, in-depth proteogenomic analysis were performed using whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA-seq, proteomics and phosphoproteomics. WES data identified 10,235 mutated genes including 20,369 non-silent point mutations and 1,363 small insertions-deletions. RNA-seq data analysis identified 19,860 protein-coding genes. Isobaric tandem mass tags (TMT)-based global proteomics identified 10,783 proteins; phosphoproteomics identified 59,746 highly reliable phosphosites from 9,224 phosphoproteins. We found that 35.2% (56/159) of the patients harbored aristolochic acids (AAs) signature (A:T >T:A transversions), and the AA signature-resulting single amino acid mutations were also identified in the proteomic data. Proteomic profiling identified three subgroups associated with clinical and molecular attributes including patient survival, tumor thrombus, genetic profile, and the liver-specific proteome. These proteomic subgroups have distinct features in metabolic reprogramming, microenvironment dysregulation, cell proliferation, and potential therapeutics. CTNNB1-associated ALDOA phosphorylation was validated to promote glycolysis and cell proliferation. Our study provides a valuable resource that significantly expands the knowledge of HBV-related HCC and may eventually benefit clinical practice.
