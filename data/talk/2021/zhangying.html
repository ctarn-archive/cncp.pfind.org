<h3>MS-based Approaches for Analysis of Glycosylation and Application</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Glycosylation is a complex form of protein modification occurring on eukaryotic proteins. It affects both the structure and function of proteins. To sensitively analyze the protein N-glycosylation by MS, we have developed a series of new approaches.To selective enrich the glycopeptides, we explored several different chemical reactions that can specifically occur between glycoproteins and solid phases including reductive amination and oxime click reaction. These methods greatly reduced the enrichment time and improve the selectivity of N-glycoprotein analysis. By using the oxime click reaction, we further designed a cross linker that can label the glycan and glycoproteins on bacterial surface in vivo and then can cross link the bacteria with its host interactors by UV irradiation, thereby enabled a time-resolved chemical proteomics strategy enabling host and pathogen temporal interaction profiling (HAPTIP) for tracking the entry of a pathogen into the host cell. Moreover, to enable the accurate quantification of the N-glycome, we developed several new novel N-glycan quantitation approaches based on isotope labeling combined with mass spectrometric analysis including metallic element chelated tag labeling (MeCTL) to increase the sample throughput and duplex stable isotope labeling (DuSIL) to quantify the sialic glycan and neutral glycans simultaneously. Recently, in response to the technical challenge in site-specific N-glycosylation analysis, we reported a chemical labeling strategy to improve the electron transfer dissociation efficiency of intact glycopeptides. This comprehensive glycosylation analysis strategy for the first time allows the discrimination of IgG3 and IgG4 intact N-glycopeptides with high similarity in sequence without the antibody-based pre-separation. In summary, these novel strategies helped the highly sensitive and specific MS analysis of the protein glycosylation.
