<h3>Discovery Molecular Targets of Natural Product Tanshintone With Quantitative Proteome</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Ischemia-reperfusion injury is an important reason for cell and tissue damage in clinical, especially during the therapy procedures of myocardial infarction. Natural products from plant Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge have been used in clinical and show benefit for the cardiovascular diseases. Our lab try to use quantitative proteomics methods to elucidate the molecular mechanisms in the ischemia-reperfusion injury and to discover the potential drug targets of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. We also developed a biotin-maleimide probe for electrophilic cysteine profiling, which can quantify more than 18,000 cysteine sites in one experiments. With this method, we discovered several potential targets of natural product Tanshintone.
