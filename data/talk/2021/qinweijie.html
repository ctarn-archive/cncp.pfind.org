<h3>An RNA tagging approach for system-wide RNA-binding proteome profiling and dynamics investigation upon transcription inhibition</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
RNA-protein interactions play key roles in epigenetic, transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. To reveal the regulatory mechanisms of these interactions, global investigation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and monitor their changes under various physiological conditions are needed. Herein, we developed a psoralen probe (PP)-based method for RNA tagging and ribonucleic-protein complex (RNP) enrichment. Isolation of both coding and noncoding RNAs and mapping of 2986 RBPs including 782 un-known candidate RBPs from HeLa cells was achieved by PP enrichment, RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis. The dynamics study of RNPs by PP enrichment after the inhibition of RNA synthesis provides the first large-scale distribution profile of RBPs bound to RNAs with different decay rates. Furthermore, the remarkably greater decreases in the abundance of the RBPs obtained by PP-enrichment than by global proteome profiling suggest that PP enrichment after transcription inhibition offers a valuable way for large-scale evaluation of the candidate RBPs.
