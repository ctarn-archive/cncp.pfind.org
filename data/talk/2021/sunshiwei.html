<h3>Toward Automated Identiﬁcation of Glycan Branching Patterns Using Multistage Mass Spectrometry with Intelligent Precursor Selection</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Glycans play important roles in a variety of biological processes. Their activities are closely related to the fine details of their structures. Unlike the simple linear chains of proteins, branching is a unique feature of glycan structures, making their identification extremely challenging. Multistage mass spectrometry (MSn) has become the primary method for glycan structural identification. The major difficulty for MSn is the selection of fragment ions as precursors for the next stage of scanning. Widely-used strategies are either manual selection by experienced experts, which requires considerable expertise and time, or simply selecting the most intense peaks by which the product-ion spectrum generated may not be structurally informative and therefore fail to make the assignment. We here report an ‘intelligent precursor selection’ strategy (GIPS) to guide MSn experiments. Our approach consists of two key elements, an empirical model to calculate candidate glycan’s ‘probability’ and a statistical model to calculate fragment ion’s ‘distinguishing power’ in order to select the structurally-most informative peak as the precursor for next-stage scanning. Using 13 glycan standards, including 3 pairs with isomeric sequences, and 8 variously fucosylated oligosaccharides on linear or branched hexasaccharide backbones obtained from a human milk oligosaccharide fraction by HPLC, we demonstrate its successful application to branching pattern analysis with improved efficiency and sensitivity, and also the potential for automated operation.
