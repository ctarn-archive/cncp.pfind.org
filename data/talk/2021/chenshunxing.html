<h3>Profiling Intracellular Protein-Protein and Protein-Chemical Interactions at Scale with Cellular Biophysics Proteomics</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
The interaction of proteins with chemicals and other proteins underlies all cellular activities, and many bioactive compounds modulate the molecular functions of proteins through direct physical interactions. Mapping these interactions will reveal internal wiring of the cells providing insight into how these interactions are dysregulated in diseases and perturbed by chemicals. However, there are currently limited time- and cost-effective techniques for global profiling of intracellular protein-protein and protein-chemical interactions. The recent Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) verifies the intracellular binding of experimental drugs to its intended protein targets, and had been integrated with quantitative MS (termed Thermal Proteome Profiling, TPP) into a modification-free drug target deconvolution technique. My laboratory had the privilege of contributing to the extension of this technique for metabolite-binding and membrane proteins, and had recently adapted it to simultaneously assess the intracellular assembly state for thousands of protein complexes, based on an unorthodox concept termed Thermal Proximity Co-aggregation (TPCA). Both MS-based CETSA and TPCA require neither tedious modification of chemicals nor cell engineering that greatly increase their throughput potential. I will describe recent experimental and computational advancements made in my laboratory to these techniques for profiling intracellular protein-protein interaction and protein-chemical interaction networks at scale toward “inter”Omics.
