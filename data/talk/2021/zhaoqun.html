<h3>Novel Methods for Chemical Crosslinking Based Protein Complex Analysis</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry (CXMS) has emerged as a powerful tool to assist traditional technologies to study protein structure and proteinâ€“protein interaction with advantages of providing direct interaction sites, less time-consuming and less demanding on sample purity. However, application of CXMS is still limited by the high complexity of CXMS samples, the low abundance of cross-linked peptides, and so on. Besides, how to realize the in-situ protein complex analysis with the lowest cell interference, and further analyze the dynamic conformation and interaction changes at both temporal and spatial dimensions, is an important issue for precisely characterizing the protein complexes, further to elucidate their functions. In response to the above problems, our team has developed a series of methods to improve the depth of chemical crosslinks and realize the in-situ dynamic analysis of protein complexes at temporal and spatial dimensions. And the obtained results suggested our developed strategy might be a promising tool for the global analysis of protein complexes assembly.
