<h3>Proteomics in the Development of Vaccines against Bacterial Infections</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
The proteomics strategy based on mass spectrometry technology has become one of the common useful methods in the field of life sciences. Vaccine technology is an important means used by us to fight against pathogens (including bacteria and viruses). Here, the proteomics applications in the researches of bacterial pathogenesis and in the developments of vaccines will be discussed. First, the identification of bacterial intein and cyclic peptides might be improved by computational proteomics. In addition, computational algorithm also helps in the screening of antigen epitopes (MHC-binding peptides from pathogens) and the design of delivery vectors (protein nanoparticles) during the vaccine development process.
