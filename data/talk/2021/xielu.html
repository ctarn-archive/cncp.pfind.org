<h3>Proteogenomics analysis for tumor neoantigen prediction and identification</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Neoantigens can function as actual antigens to facilitate tumor rejection, which play a crucial role in cancer immunotherapy. However, timely and efficient identification of neoantigens is still a major obstacle to personalized neoantigen-based cancer immunotherapy. To this end, our previous studies provide a platform for identifying tumor neoantigen, which includes a database for human tumor neoantigen peptides: dbPepNeo, a proteogenomics neoantigen prediction pipeline: ProGeo-neo, and a machine learning algorithm for prediction of neoepitope immunogenicity: INeo-Epp. With the application of neoantigens in immunotherapy and the development of proteogenomics, the requirements for the source range and prediction accuracy of neoantigens have been increased. Therefore, we have extended the neoantigen prediction platform. dbPepNeo2.0 catalogs more than 800 experimentally validated immunogenic neoantigens (MHC-Ⅰ/MHC-Ⅱ) and corresponding 648 TCR sequences. In addition, 251 medium confidence and 864884 low confidence neoantigens were also included. Furthermore, dbPepNeo2.0 provide a deep learning model for predicting immunogenicity of neoantigens based on convolutional neural network: DeepCNN-Ineo. ProGeo-neo2.0 is an integrated computational pipeline to identify neoantigens based on proteogenomics, which can predict neoantigens from a variety of mutant types, including SNV, InDel and gene fusion. In addition, ProGeo-neo2.0 adds functional modules for predicting neoantigens bound to MHC-Ⅱ molecules. Furthermore, in order to provide guidance for tumor types with low tumor mutation load and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the tumor immune landscape, we extend the neoantigen source to the noncoding regions and construct a proteogenomics-based neoantigen prediction pipeline in noncoding regions, namely PGNneo. In summary, our study results in a proteogenomic platform to promote the predication and confirmation of potential neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy.
