<h3>Systematic Investigation of Key Regulatory Elements for Lysine lactylation and β-hydroxybutyrylation</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Short-chain fatty acids and their corresponding acyl-CoAs sit at the crossroads of multiple metabolic pathways and play important roles in diverse cellular processes. Two noteworthy examples are the newly identified protein posttranlation modifications (PTMs), lysine lactylation (Kla) and β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb), which are derived from lactate and β-hydroxybutyrate, respectively. We have demonstrated that both histone Kla and Kbhb directly stimulates transcription, and established novel functions for lactate and β-hydroxybutyrate to regulate gene expressions. However, key elements for regulating these physiology-relevant pathways remain unknown, hindering characterization of mechanisms by which these modifications exert their biological functions. Here we systemetically investigate the key regulatory enzymes and substrates of Kla and Kbhb, which will illuminates the landscape of the Kla and Kbhb pathways and lays a solid foundation for future studies of these pathways in cellular physiology and human diseases.
