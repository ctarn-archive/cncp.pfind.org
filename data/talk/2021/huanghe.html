<h3>Systematic Investigation of Key Regulatory Elements for Lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Short-chain fatty acids and their corresponding acyl-CoAs sit at the crossroads of multiple metabolic pathways and play important roles in diverse cellular processes. A noteworthy example is the newly identified protein posttranlation modifications (PTMs), lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb), which are derived from one of the ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate. We have demonstrated that histone Kbhb directly stimulates transcription, and established novel functions for β-hydroxybutyrate to regulate gene expressions. However, key elements for regulating this physiology-relevant pathway remain unknown, hindering characterization of mechanisms by which this modification exert its biological functions. Here we systemetically investigate the key regulatory enzymes and substrates of Kbhb, which will illuminates the landscape of the Kbhb pathway and lays a solid foundation for future studies of this pathway in cellular physiology and human diseases.
