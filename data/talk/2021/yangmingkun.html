<h3>Proteogenomic analyses for Genome Annotation and Global Profiling of Post-Translational Modifications</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Proteogenomics is referred as the use of mass spectrometry (MS)-derived proteomic data to annotate the protein coding genes and improve genome annotation quality. Currently there is no software dedicated to conducting eukaryotic proteogenomic analyses, and most previous studies did not simultaneously address the whole process in a holistic way. We recently developed an integrated proteogenomic pipeline (GAPE) for annotating genomes and conducted a global analysis of PTMs common in eukaryotes. Using this pipeline, which was designed to be integrated and automated, we generated a customized protein database, performed spectral searches, integrated identified PSMs, identified novel events (novel proteins, AS genes, and SAAVs), revised annotated proteins, and performed global profiling of PTM events. Through this approach, we were able to unambiguously identified approximately 8300 genes and revealed 606 novel proteins, 506 revised genes, 94 splice variants, 58 single amino acid variants, and a holistic view of post-translational modifications in Phaeodactylum tricornutum. We experimentally confirmed a subset of novel events and obtained MS evidence for more than 200 micropeptides in Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The proteogenomic pipeline we developed in this study is applicable to any sequenced eukaryote and thus represents a significant contribution to the toolset for eukaryotic proteogenomic analysis.
