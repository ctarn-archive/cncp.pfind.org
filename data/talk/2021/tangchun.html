<h3>A personal guide for distilling protein structure and dynamics information from cross-linking MS data</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XLMS) has been increasingly employed for the structural characterization of proteins and protein complexes. Photo- or chemical cross-linking connects two adjacent residues within a relatively short distance, and the cross-linked peptides can be identified by mass spectrometry with high confidence. However, there are three caveats associated with XLMS-based structural biology and structural proteomics:
<ol>
<li>Proteins and protein complexes are usually dynamic. Therefore, the cross-linking reaction can capture and manifest alternative protein conformations, while the observed XLMS data should be interpreted with an ensemble of structures.</li>
<li>Cross-linking implicitly involves two consecutive reactions. Thus, the dynamic timescale of the cross-linker versus the dynamic timescale of the protein can impact the observed XL-MS data. The reaction kinetics issue can especially matter for the intrinsically disordered proteins.</li>
<li>XLMS data manifest inter-residue distances, which had mostly been represented with straight-line distances. Since the cross-linker cannot penetrate the protein, a new type of distance restraint has been developed to recapitulate the inter-residue solvent-accessible distance.</li>
</ol>
Together, proper care and control should be performed when characterizing protein structure and dynamics using the XLMS data.
