<h3>Proteomic Subtyping as a Postoperative Recurrence Risk Assessment Analysis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Proteomics are increasingly important in predicting clinical outcomes. The quantitative proteomic data has suggested the heterogeneity in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and are used to stratify the cohort into three subtypes (i.e., S-I, S-II and S-III) with different clinical outcomes, but larger cohorts and comprehensive proteomic analysis are needed in order to provide definitive answers. we established a proteomic pipeline integrating the data-independent acquisition (DIA) on four mass spectrometers (MS) in parallel and spectral library-based database-searching. The proteomics pipeline was not only robust for analyzing snap-frozen sample, but also for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. There are 1,024 patients with primary HCC from three independently cohorts in our analyses. To further verify the proteomic subtyping in real world, we identified the subtypes of all the recruited HCC patients of this study using SRPS algorithm. Cox regression analysis showed the proteomic subtypes were significantly associated with overall survival and disease free survival independent of clinical and pathological features. In summary, the proteomic subtypes do not only apply to the early-stage HCC patients with HBV infection, but also suitable to the HCC patients with BCLC stage B, HCC patients without HBV infection or cirrhosis, showing the universality of proteomic subtypes in HCC patients.
