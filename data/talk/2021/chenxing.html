<h3>Chemical Labeling-Assisted Glycoproteomics</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Protein glycosylation, attachment of glycans to specific amino acids via glycosidic bonds, is the most ubiquitous and complex posttranslational modification.  Based on the glycosidic bond and glycan structure, the major types of protein glycosylation include N-linked glycosylation, mucin-type O-linked glycosylation, and O-GlcNAcylation. Comprehensive analysis of protein glycosylation is a prerequisite for understanding the biological function of protein glycosylation, but remains challenging.  To address this challenge, we take advantage of chemical labeling of glycans with clickable unnatural sugars and develop an effective platform for comprehensive analysis of intact N- and O-glycopeptides in one sample from cell lysates and tissues.  The chemical labeling-assisted glycoproteomics strategy is applied to generate large-scale datasets of protein glycosylation in various tissues of mice, demonstrating its potential in facilitating our understanding of glycobiology.
