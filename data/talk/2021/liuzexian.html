<h3>Genetic variation driven PTM aberrances: from molecular mechanism to targeted cancer therapies</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) were critical for regulating cellular processes, and their aberrances were heavily implicated in cancer. Massive PTM sites have been identified through experimental identification and high-throughput proteomics techniques, however, their enzyme-specific regulation remains largely unknown. Recently, we developed the Deep-PLA software for HAT/HDAC-specific acetylation prediction based on deep learning, and employed the proteinâ€“protein interaction and co-sublocalization to reduce filter the false positive predictions. Through large-scale prediction based on TCGA cancer omics data, it was observed that mutations more frequently occurred at the region around acetylation sites, and acetylation-related mutations (ARMs) had higher variant allele fraction values than non-ARMs, which meant these mutations might be more functional in cancer. Furthermore, ARM proteins were significantly enriched in cancer genes and druggable proteins, and clinical survival analysis demonstrated that the patients with at least one ARM had significantly worse clinical prognosis in cancers such as head-neck squamous cell carcinoma. Besides the substrates and sites, we also studied the enzymes of PTMs, for example, HER2, which is the targeted kinase by trastuzumab in HER2 positive gastric cancer. Through monitoring patients by ctDNA, it was observed that the mutations of PIK3CA/R1/C3 or ERBB2/4 could indicated the trastuzumab resistance. Additionally, mutations in NF1 contributed to trastuzumab resistance, which was further confirmed through in vitro and in vivo studies, while combined HER2 and MEK/ERK blockade overcame trastuzumab resistance. Taken together, the PTM systems including the substrates, sites and enzymes, were critical in cancer, and further studies should be contributed to this area.
