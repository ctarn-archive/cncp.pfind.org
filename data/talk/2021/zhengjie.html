<h3>Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange Mass spectrometry â€“ Hijacking molecular plasticity to fine tune receptor signalling</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
While proteins are often depicted as static models, they exhibit a degree of structural plasticity in solution. Characterizing this structural plasticity is essential for understanding the relationship between structure and function. In this talk, I will present the latest advances of solution-phase hydrogen-deuterium exchange Mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) on receptor signaling events derived from key diseases mechanisms related to nuclear receptor signaling and innate immunity receptor associated autoimmune diseases. Our laboratory adopts a synergistic strategy for structure-function studies by coupling the solution-phase solvent exchange measurements from HDX with static structures to inform the dynamic properties of macromolecules.
