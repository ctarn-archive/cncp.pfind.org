<h3>Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry reveals a tethering mechanism of MDA5-MAVS signaling cascade by long K63-polyUbiquitin chains</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Homotypic ubiquitin chains play critical roles in a wide range of innate immune signaling pathways. MDA5 senses cytosolic viral RNAs and endogenous retroelements to activate MAVS via a CARD-CARD interaction. Here, we used HDX-MS to probe the K63-polyUbn-mediated tetramerization of MDA5CARDs. We resolved cryo-EM structures - a polyUb13-bound MDA5CARDs tetramer and a polyUb11-bound MDA5CARDs-MAVSCARD assembly – that resemble a hierarchical signaling tower. HDX-MS studies further reveal that MDA5-RNA engagement upon ATP binding and hydrolysis allows the multiprotein complex to remotely stabilize the CARDs-polyUb complex for sustained signaling prior to MAVS activation. Yet abundant ATP could prevent unwanted basal activation of apo MDA5 against unanchored K63-polyUb chains. Our data reveal a K63-polyUb mediated tethering mechanism preferably adopted by MDA5-MAVS signaling cascade crucial for antiviral responses and immune homeostasis.
