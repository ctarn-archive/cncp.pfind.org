<h3>Quantitative Proteomics for Ubiquitination Detection and Functional Researches</h3>

<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Ubiquitin chains, as the carriers of biological information, perform specific biological functions and constitute the "Ubiquitin Code" system. The lack of systematic and efficient screening strategies for atypical ubiquitin chain modified substrates limits the study on identification and functional mechanism of atypical ubiquitin chain modified substrates. Also the ubiquitination signal network is reversely trimmed through deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB). The specificity of DUBs and ubiquitin chains was challenging but meritorious, which help us deeply understand the precise regulatory mechanism of UPS enzymes and substrates. Technically it is remaining challenge to directly display the specificity of certain DUB for their corresponding ubiquitin linkages. To improve the detection sensitivity and coverage for ubiquitin chains and modified sites, we developed tandem hybrid UBD (ThUBD) to enrich the ubiquitinated proteins and constructed the trypsin and LysargiNase tandem digestion strategy to improve the modified sites identification. According to these high-performance technologies, we used budding yeast to establish a high-throughput profiling and validation strategy for substrate modified by atypical ubiquitin chain based on quantitative proteomics. High-throughput screening of the substrates modified by K11 atypical ubiquitin chain were conducted to reveal its molecular functions on the transcription activation of Met4, providing a theoretical basis for the discovery of new functions of K11 atypical ubiquitin chain. We also employed SILAC quantitative proteomics approaches to systematically evaluate the specificity of DUBs on all seven types of ubiquitin chains. Based on the specificity, we proved the precise regulation and functions of ubiquitin modification on substrates through DUBs. The signal “DUBs – Ub chains – substrate – function” become the basis of precise regulation mechanism of ubiquitin networks.
